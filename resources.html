				<h1>Resources for Homeless in SF</h1>
				<p>There are a wide range of resources provided by both the government and various other organization to assist the homeless population of San Francisco, however, these resources are hard to find. They are spread across many websites, some even hosted by the same government departments. Here I have tried to collect links to the various resource pages of the different agencies and organizations doing work in San Francisco.</p>
				<p>All descriptions to the right are clickable links</p>

					<h3>Departmet of Homelessness and Supportive Housing</h3>
					<p>This is another of the many SF government pages. The Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing (HSH) has a singular focus on preventing and ending homelessness for people in San Francisco. HSH strives to make homelessness in San Francisco rare, brief, and one-time, through the provision of coordinated, compassionate, and high‚Äêquality services.</p>
