				<h1>Causes of Homelessness in SF</h1>
				<p>There are many causes of homelessness in the San Francisco Bay Area and no two people's stories are the same. This page aims to give a general overview of the environmental factors that have caused such a crisis to occur. This page does not include every cause.</p>

					<p>Since the 1960s, San Francisco and the Bay Area have implemented strict zoning regulations, such as limiting building heights and facilitating resident opposition to new developments, leading to a shortage of new homes. This shortage is evident from 2007 to 2014, during which only half of the needed houses were permitted despite population growth. In September 2019, the Council of Economic Advisers projected significant reductions in homelessness through housing market deregulation, estimating declines of 54% in San Francisco, 40% in Los Angeles, and 38% in San Diego, attributing these to rent decreases of 55%, 41%, and 39%, respectively. However, despite efforts such as the Eastern Neighborhoods Community Planning Process initiated in 2002 to address land use conflicts and enable residential rezoning in industrial areas, the plan's adoption in 2008 led to increased housing disparity. This disparity forced socioeconomically disadvantaged and ethnic minority groups into under-resourced neighborhoods or homelessness, exacerbating health issues for marginalized populations while failing to alleviate the worsening homelessness and housing crisis.</p>

					<p>Gentrification in the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly in cities like Oakland and San Francisco, has raised significant concerns. The Urban Displacement Project, a collaborative effort by UC Berkeley, UCLA, and Portland State University, aims to analyze the relationships between investment, neighborhood change, gentrification, and displacement. The project has developed a mapping tool to track displacement and gentrification in the area. Factors contributing to gentrification include rising income inequality and the tech industry's rapid growth, which has created a high demand for housing but faces severe restrictions on new construction. This imbalance has led to dramatic increases in rents and housing prices, exacerbating the housing crisis. Displacement of low-income residents has resulted in increased health risks, including preventable mortality. Advocates have pushed for regulations like inclusionary zoning to protect affordable housing, and protests, such as the Black Lives Matter movement's action on the Bay Bridge in 2016, have demanded divestment from policing and investment in sustainable, affordable housing to support marginalized communities.</p>

					<p>In the 1960s, strict zoning regulations were implemented in San Francisco and neighboring Bay Area cities, aimed at segregating land uses like residential, industrial, and commercial. San Francisco's zoning laws also restrict building height, density, and shape, as well as prohibit the demolition of old buildings. Originally designed for public health reasons, these regulations have been manipulated by homeowners to artificially inflate housing prices. The housing crisis extends both regionally and locally, with gentrification and exclusion closely intertwined at the neighborhood level. High-demand, high-cost neighborhoods that resist development divert housing seekers to nearby low-cost areas, driving up demand and leading to gentrification. Residents of expensive neighborhoods, typically possessing mobility, wealth, and influence, effectively use land-use policies to exclude newcomers. Exclusionary zoning in San Francisco exacerbates housing affordability and accessibility issues, effectively creating enclaves for the wealthy while pricing out lower-income families and displacing communities, contributing to rising homelessness rates.</p>

					<p>Until 1968, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) implemented a discriminatory redlining policy, denying mortgage loans to racial minority groups. This practice encouraged homeowners to sell exclusively to white families, leading to the formation of all-white neighborhoods. Despite being outlawed by the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the legacy of neighborhood segregation based on race and class persists, resulting in deprived neighborhoods lacking vital resources like housing, schools, healthcare facilities, and grocery stores. Zoning policies in San Francisco further exacerbated these divisions, deepening income inequality and segregating communities based on socioeconomic status. This disparity is notably evident in the Tenderloin District, which currently faces the highest rates of homelessness.</p>

					<p>In their 2022 book titled "Homelessness is a Housing Problem," Clayton Page Aldern, a policy analyst and data scientist from Seattle, and Gregg Colburn, an assistant professor of real estate at the University of Washingtonâ€™s College of Built Environments, examined per capita homelessness rates across the United States and investigated potential influencing factors. Their research concluded that high rates of homelessness stem primarily from shortages of affordable housing, rather than factors such as mental illness, drug addiction, or poverty. They observed that while mental illness, drug addiction, and poverty are prevalent nationwide, not all areas face equally high housing costs. For instance, states like Arkansas and West Virginia, despite having high rates of opioid addiction, have low per capita homelessness rates due to affordable housing prices. Similarly, despite being one of the poorest cities, Detroit's per capita homelessness rate is significantly lower (20%) than that of West Coast cities like Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, highlighting the correlation between housing affordability and homelessness rates.</p>
